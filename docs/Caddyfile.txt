/*
    reverse_proxy means: 
        reverse_proxy tells Caddy to forward all incoming traffic to another service.
    backend:8000 means:
        backend = the Docker service name (from docker-compose.yaml). Docker’s internal DNS resolves this name to the container’s internal IP.
        8000 = the port your Node.js backend is listening on inside the container.

/*
    root * /usr/share/caddy
        root: root sets the directory where your static files (your built React app) are located.
        (*) means "for all request paths".
        /usr/share/caddy is the default web root inside the Caddy container where you copied your Vite build output (/dist).

    file_server
        Tells Caddy to serve static files from the root directory.
        It automatically handles things like:
            Serving index.html for React single-page apps
            Setting MIME types
            Directory listing (disabled by default for security)
            Caching headers
